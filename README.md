## I present my small game project in typescript and react.

## Paper Scissor Rock

### `If you want to view the game go to the link:`

 - https://react-g-rock-paper-scissors.netlify.app/

### `The application works with the backend located at this address:`

- https://github.com/KarolDawidG/Rock_Paper_Scissors_backend

You don't need to use this link to start the application. Everything works online.
The front-end in React is deployed on netlify.com, and the back-end in Express.js is deployed on ct8.pl.

### `Soon in the project will be added:`
- hero selection will be added;
- maybe more unnecessary features will be added in such a trivial game.

### STAY TUNED

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run log`

Runs the all git logs in one line mode.\


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
