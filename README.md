## I present my small game project in typescript and react.

## Paper Scissor Rock

All pictures were generated by artificial intelligence!

### `If you want to view the game go to the link:`

 - https://react-g-rock-paper-scissors.netlify.app/

### `The application works with the backend located at this address:`

- https://github.com/KarolDawidG/Rock_Paper_Scissors_backend

You don't need to use this link to start the application. Everything works online.
The front-end in React is deployed on netlify.com, and the back-end in Express.js is deployed on ct8.pl.

### `Soon in the project will be added:`
- hero selection will be added;
- maybe more unnecessary features will be added in such a trivial game.

### STAY TUNED

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run log`

Runs the all git logs in one line mode.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
